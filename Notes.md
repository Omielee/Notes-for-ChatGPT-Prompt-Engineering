## Two types of large language models (LLMs)
- Base LLM: predicts next word
  - Eg. today is **a sunny day.** The bold words are the prediction.
- Instruction tuned LLM: tries to follow instructions
  - RLHF: Reinforcement learning with human feedback
  - Eg. What is the capital of France? **The capital is Paris.** The bold words are following the instructions.
